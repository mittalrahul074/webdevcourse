<p>Introduction JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the internet, and
works in all major browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Chrome, Opera, and Safari.
 JavaScript is used in billions of Web pages to add functionality, validate
forms, communicate with the server, and much more.
    
What is JavaScript?
 JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages
 JavaScript is a scripting language
 A scripting language is a lightweight programming language
 JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages
 JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute
without preliminary compilation)
 Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing a license
    
What Can JavaScript do?
 JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML
authors are normally not programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language
with a very simple syntax!
 JavaScript can react to events - A JavaScript can be set to execute when
something happens, like when a page has finished loading or when a user
clicks on an HTML element
 JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - A JavaScript can read
and change the content of an HTML element
 JavaScript can be used to validate data - A JavaScript can be used to
validate form data before it is submitted to a server. This saves the server
from extra processing
 JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser - A JavaScript
can be used to detect the visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser -
load another page specifically designed for that browser
 JavaScript can be used to create cookies - A JavaScript can be used to
store and retrieve information on the visitor's computer
    
History
 JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape (with 
Navigator 2.0), and has appeared in all browsers since 1996.
 The official standardization was adopted by the ECMA organization (an 
industry standardization association) in 1997. 
 ECMA-262 is the official JavaScript standard</p>
    <ul>Data types</ul>
<p>Javascript Data Types
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
Primitive data type
Non-primitive (reference) data type
JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. 
You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:
var a=40;//holding number  
var b="Rahul";//holding string  

JavaScript primitive data types
There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

Data Type	    Description
String	     represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number	     represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean	     represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined	 represents undefined value
Null	     represents null i.e. no value at all

 
JavaScript non-primitive data types
The non-primitive data types are as follows:

Data Type	    Description
Object	    represents instance through which we can access members
Array	    represents group of similar values
RegExp	    represents regular expression</p>
    <ul>Variables</ul>
<p>Variables
 Variables are "containers" for storing information.
Rules for JavaScript variable names:
 Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are two different variables)
 Variable names must begin with a letter, the $ character, or the 
underscore character
Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables
var x;
var carname="Volvo";
Local JavaScript Variables
 A variable declared within a JavaScript function becomes LOCAL and 
can only be accessed within that function. (the variable has local scope).
 Local variables are destroyed when you exit the function.
Global JavaScript Variables
 Variables declared outside a function become GLOBAL, and all scripts 
and functions on the web page can access it.
 Global variables are destroyed when you close the page.
 If you declare a variable, without using "var", the variable always 
becomes GLOBAL.</p>
    <ul>Constants</ul>
<p>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

Cannot be Reassigned
A const variable cannot be reassigned.
Must be Assigned
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

Correct
const PI = 3.14159265359;
Incorrect
const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;
When to use JavaScript const?
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp
Constant Objects and Arrays
The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:
Change the elements of constant array.
Change the properties of constant object.

Constant Arrays
You can change the elements of a constant array.
But you can NOT reassign the array.
Constant Objects
You can change the properties of a constant object.
But you can NOT reassign the object.
    Block Scope
Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.

The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block:
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScropt const variables has block scope</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
const x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "x is " + x;
</script>

</body>
</html>.

Redeclaring
Redeclaring a JavaScript var variable is allowed anywhere in a program:

Example
var x = 2;     // Allowed
var x = 3;     // Allowed
x = 4;         // Allowed
Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
var x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed

{
let x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}

{
const x = 2;   // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
const x = 2;     // Allowed
x = 2;           // Not allowed
var x = 2;       // Not allowed
let x = 2;       // Not allowed
const x = 2;     // Not allowed

{
  const x = 2;   // Allowed
  x = 2;         // Not allowed
  var x = 2;     // Not allowed
  let x = 2;     // Not allowed
  const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:

Example
const x = 2;       // Allowed

{
  const x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
  const x = 4;   // Allowed
}
Const Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared.

If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.
Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.
Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<p>With <b>const</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

try {
  alert(carName);
  const carName = "Volvo";
}
catch (err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
}

</script>
</body>
</html>.
<ul>Arithmeticoperators</ul>
    <p>Arithmetic Operators
JavaScript supports the following arithmetic operators −

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −

Sr.No.	Operator & Description
1	
+ (Addition)

Adds two operands

Ex: A + B will give 30

2	
- (Subtraction)

Subtracts the second operand from the first

Ex: A - B will give -10

3	
* (Multiplication)

Multiply both operands

Ex: A * B will give 200

4	
/ (Division)

Divide the numerator by the denominator

Ex: B / A will give 2

5	
% (Modulus)

Outputs the remainder of an integer division

Ex: B % A will give 0

6	
++ (Increment)

Increases an integer value by one

Ex: A++ will give 11

7	
-- (Decrement)

Decreases an integer value by one

Ex: A-- will give 9

Note − Addition operator (+) works for Numeric as well as Strings. e.g. "a" + 10 will give "a10".

Example
The following code shows how to use arithmetic operators in JavaScript.

    <ul>Expression</ul>
<p>A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters.

The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions 
    to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text.

Syntax
A regular expression could be defined with the RegExp () constructor, as follows −

var pattern = new RegExp(pattern, attributes);
or simply
var pattern = /pattern/attributes;
Here is the description of the parameters −

pattern − A string that specifies the pattern of the regular expression or another regular expression.

attributes − An optional string containing any of the "g", "i", and "m" attributes that specify global, case-insensitive, and multi-line matches, respectively.

Brackets
Brackets ([]) have a special meaning when used in the context of regular expressions. They are used to find a range of characters.

Sr.No.	Expression & Description
1	
[...]

Any one character between the brackets.

2	
[^...]

Any one character not between the brackets.

3	
[0-9]

It matches any decimal digit from 0 through 9.

It matches any character from lowercase a through lowercase z.

5	
[A-Z]

It matches any character from uppercase A through uppercase Z.

6	
[a-Z]

It matches any character from lowercase a through uppercase Z.

The ranges shown above are general; you could also use the range [0-3] to match any decimal digit ranging from 0 through 3, 
    or the range [b-v] to match any lowercase character ranging from b through v.

Quantifiers
The frequency or position of bracketed character sequences and single characters can be denoted by a special character. 
    Each special character has a specific connotation. The +, *, ?, and $ flags all follow a character sequence.

Sr.No.	Expression & Description
1	
p+

It matches any string containing one or more p's.

2	
p*

It matches any string containing zero or more p's.

5	
p{2,3}

It matches any string containing a sequence of two or three p's.

6	
p{2, }

It matches any string containing a sequence of at least two p's.

7	
p$

It matches any string with p at the end of it.

8

Metacharacters
A metacharacter is simply an alphabetical character preceded by a backslash that acts to give the combination a special meaning.

For instance, you can search for a large sum of money using the '\d' metacharacter: /([\d]+)000/, Here \d will search for any string of numerical character.

The following table lists a set of metacharacters which can be used in PERL Style Regular Expressions.

In the following sections, we will have a few examples to demonstrate the usage of RegExp properties.

RegExp Methods
Here is a list of the methods associated with RegExp along with their description.

Sr.No.	Method & Description
1	exec()
Executes a search for a match in its string parameter.

2	test()
Tests for a match in its string parameter.

3	toSource()
Returns an object literal representing the specified object; you can use this value to create a new object.

4	toString()
Returns a string representing the specified object.

In the following sections, we will have a few examples to demonstrate the usage of RegExp methods.</p>
    <ul>Decision making and control statement</ul>
<p>Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
The switch statement is described in the next chapter.
   
The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
Syntax
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.
    
The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}</p>
    <ul>Functions</ul>
    <p>avaScript Functions
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.

Advantage of JavaScript function
There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.

Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
JavaScript Function Syntax
The syntax of declaring function is given below.

function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
 //code to be executed  
}  
JavaScript Functions can have 0 or more arguments.
Example:
Let’s see the simple example of function in JavaScript that does not has arguments.

<script>  
function msg(){  
alert("hello! this is message");  
}  
</script>  
<input type="button" onclick="msg()" value="call function"/>

JavaScript Function Arguments:
We can call function by passing arguments. Let’s see the example of function that has one argument.

<script>  
function getcube(number){  
alert(number*number*number);  
}  
</script>  
<form>  
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="getcube(4)"/>  
</form>
    
Function with Return Value
We can call function that returns a value and use it in our program. Let’s see the example of function that returns value.

<script>  
function getInfo(){  
return "hello javatpoint! How r u?";  
}  
</script>  
<script>  
document.write(getInfo());  
</script> 
    
JavaScript Function Object
In JavaScript, the purpose of Function constructor is to create a new Function object. It executes the code globally. However, 
    if we call the constructor directly, a function is created dynamically but in an unsecured way.

Syntax
new Function ([arg1[, arg2[, ....argn]],] functionBody)  
Parameter
arg1, arg2, .... , argn - It represents the argument used by function.

functionBody - It represents the function definition.

JavaScript Function Methods
Let's see function methods with description.

Method	Description
apply()
It is used to call a function contains this value and a single array of arguments.
bind()
It is used to create a new function.
call()
It is used to call a function contains this value and an argument list.
toString()
It returns the result in a form of a string.</p>
    
    <ul>Arrays</ul>
<p>The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
    An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Syntax
Use the following syntax to create an Array object −

var fruits = new Array( "apple", "orange", "mango" );
The Array parameter is a list of strings or integers. When you specify a single numeric parameter with the Array constructor, 
    you specify the initial length of the array. The maximum length allowed for an array is 4,294,967,295.

You can create array by simply assigning values as follows −

var fruits = [ "apple", "orange", "mango" ];
You will use ordinal numbers to access and to set values inside an array as follows.

fruits[0] is the first element
fruits[1] is the second element
fruits[2] is the third element
Array Properties
Here is a list of the properties of the Array object along with their description.

Sr.No.	Property & Description
1	constructor

    <ul>Built in objects:
        <ul>Maths</ul>
<p>The math object provides you properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Unlike other global objects, Math is not a constructor. 
            All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using Math as an object without creating it.

Thus, you refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method's argument.

Syntax
The syntax to call the properties and methods of Math are as follows

var pi_val = Math.PI;
var sine_val = Math.sin(30);

<p> The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.

As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.

Syntax
Use the following syntax to create a String object −

var val = new String(string);
The String parameter is a series of characters that has been properly encoded.

        <ul>Date</ul>
<p>  The Date object is a datatype built into the JavaScript language. Date objects are created with the new Date( ) as shown below.

Once a Date object is created, a number of methods allow you to operate on it. Most methods simply allow you to get and set the year, 
    month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond fields of the object, using either local time or UTC (universal, or GMT) time.

The ECMAScript standard requires the Date object to be able to represent any date and time, to millisecond precision, within 100 million days 
    before or after 1/1/1970. This is a range of plus or minus 273,785 years, so JavaScript can represent date and time till the year 275755.

Syntax
You can use any of the following syntaxes to create a Date object using Date() constructor.

new Date( )
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(datestring)
new Date(year,month,date[,hour,minute,second,millisecond ])
Note − Parameters in the brackets are always optional.

Here is a description of the parameters −

No Argument − With no arguments, the Date() constructor creates a Date object set to the current date and time.

milliseconds − When one numeric argument is passed, it is taken as the internal numeric representation of the date in milliseconds, 
    as returned by the getTime() method. For example, passing the argument 5000 creates a date that represents five seconds past midnight on 1/1/70.

datestring − When one string argument is passed, it is a string representation of a date, in the format accepted by the Date.parse() method.

7 agruments − To use the last form of the constructor shown above. Here is a description of each argument −

year − Integer value representing the year. For compatibility (in order to avoid the Y2K problem), you should always specify the year in full; use 1998, rather than 98.

month − Integer value representing the month, beginning with 0 for January to 11 for December.

date − Integer value representing the day of the month.

hour − Integer value representing the hour of the day (24-hour scale).

minute − Integer value representing the minute segment of a time reading.

second − Integer value representing the second segment of a time reading.

millisecond − Integer value representing the millisecond segment of a time reading.
